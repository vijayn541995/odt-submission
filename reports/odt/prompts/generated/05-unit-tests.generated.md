## Quality Gates
- No snapshot-only strategy for behavior-critical paths.
- Keyboard and ARIA assertions are present for interactive UI.
- Anti-flake mitigations are documented.

## Stop Conditions
- No stable assertion strategy for async behavior.
- Critical user journey lacks testability due to ambiguity.

## Expected Outputs
- reports/dev-twin/unit-test-workpack.md (markdown)
- reports/odt/unit-test-matrix.md (markdown)
